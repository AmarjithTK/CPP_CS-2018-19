## Collection of C++ programs from SCERT Kerala First year Computer Science Testbook

##### This repository contains the supporting program files needed for teaching computer science First year C++ Programming. It's not the complete and perfect resource but I have tried my best to bring most of the stuff within the reach of you guys

##### I have coded and compiled this set of Programs as a Classroom workout and I belive this can be a helpful resource for both students and teachers as I have nicely organised,compiled and debugged the code. 

### Downloading the code

#### Easy Method

    Just click on the the Clone or download section on the right side and choose Download Zip 

    Extract the files by right by using approprate software

#### Advanced method ( Using git )

    Open terminal

    Type 
    
     sudo apt-get install git-core
    
    
    Grab the link from github

    Type
    
      git clone https://github.com/AmarjithTK/CPP_CS-2018-19.git
    

    Done. It's now downloaded to your PC

### Usage

    Note that ur pc should be installed with GCC compiler
    if you dont have it then you can get it by typing 
        
    $ sudo apt install gcc
    $ sudo apt install build-essential

Navigate to the folder of the file that you want to execute

Type


    $ gcc File_name.cpp -o Output_name
    
Now your Program must be compiled

It's time to execute and run the code

    
    $ ./file_name
    

## Special Notes
This source has been primarly divided into two parts. The C++ programs of First testbook and the Second testbook. The first testbook have no subdivisions and Second tesbook has been divided into different catagories based on chapter and important concepts

## First Testbook

    * Area and perimeter of a circle 
    * ASCII value of a number
    * Average of 3 numbers 
    * A very basic C++ program
    * Program to Display something
    * Fahrenheit - Celsius Converter
    * Simple interest calculator
    * Sum of 3 numbers

## Second Testbook

### For loop
    * Average score of students using for loop
    * Factorial using for loop
    * Fibnocci sequence
    * To check whether a number is prime 
    * To display star pattern

### IF-Else ladder
    * Find the tallest person
    * Grade on the basis of marks
    * Largest number among three 
    * To check whether a leap year or not
    * Nested loop structure
    * Odd or Even number
    * Passed or failed shower
    * Print day if else
    * Square root using if else

### Switch Case
    * Arithmetic operation using switch
    * Grade using switch
    * Print day using switch
    * To check if its a vowel

### While loop
    * To check if its a palindrome using while loop
    * Sum of 10 even numbers using while loop
    * While loop structure
    * Sum of natural numbers

### Miscellaneous ones
    * Find Area using the do while loop 
    * finding the largest number using conditional operators

I'm happy to hear to your suggestions

 ## Credits 
 SCERT for giving us with a great testbook with these handful of programs to help us understand the basic concepts of C++ and go beyond the limits to become the masters of computer science. I hope you guys will update the Testbook with latest developments in computer science
