## Collection of C++ programs from SCERT first year ComputerScience Testbook
This repository contains the supporting program files needed for teaching computer science First year C++ Programming.Its not the complete and perfect resource but I have tried my best to bring most of the stuff within the reach of you guys

 I have coded and compiled this set of Programs as a Classroom workout and I belive this can be a helpful resource for both students and teachers as I have nicely organised,compiled and debugged the code. 

## Special Notes
This source has been primarly divided into two parts. The C++ programs of First testbook and the Second testbook.

## First Testbook

* Area and perimeter of a circle
* ASCII value of a number
* Average of 3 numbers 
* A very basic C++ program
* Program to Display something
* Fahrenheit - Celsius Converter
* Simple interest calculator
* Sum of 3 numbers

## Second Testbook

### For loop
    * Average score of students using for loop
    * Factorial using for loop
    * Fibnocci sequence
    * To check whether a number is prime 
    * To display star pattern

### If else ladder
    * Find the tallest person
    * Grade on the basis of marks
    * Largest number among three 
    * To check whether a leap year or not
    * Nested loop structure

    * Passed or failed shower
    * Print day if else
    * Square root using if else

### Switch Case
    * Arithmetic operation using switch
    * Grade using switch
    * Print day using switch
    * To check if its a vowel

### While loop
    * To check if its a palindrome using while loop
    * Sum of 10 even numbers using while loop
    * While loop structure
